# Pickleball Match Intelligence

A full-stack computer-vision and machine-learning project for turning ordinary smartphone pickleball footage into structured match data, interactive analytics, and tactical insights.

## Vision

The application should eventually let a player upload a match and receive:

- automated rally segmentation
- player and ball tracking
- court-position heatmaps
- movement and kitchen-transition statistics
- shot placement and shot-selection analytics
- recurring strategic-pattern detection
- evidence-backed coaching insights linked to specific rallies

The project intentionally separates perception from reasoning:

```text
Video
  -> Court calibration
  -> Player tracking
  -> Ball tracking
  -> Rally / hit / shot events
  -> Structured match representation
  -> Analytics
  -> Coaching explanation
```

## Current Status

Phase 0a (CV prototype) is implemented as a command-line pipeline for one test video:

```text
video -> manual court calibration -> player tracks -> homography -> animated top-down court
```

There is no web app, API, or database yet. See `docs/ROADMAP.md`.

## Development Setup

Requirements: [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) (it installs Python 3.13 automatically). ML code runs natively; on Apple Silicon it uses the PyTorch `mps` device.

```bash
uv sync                 # create .venv and install the workspace
uv run pytest           # unit tests
uv run ruff check ml    # lint
uv run mypy             # type check
```

Pretrained detector weights are downloaded into `weights/` (gitignored) on first use.

## Running the Phase 0 Pipeline

Each stage writes to `data/processed/<video_name>/` and the next stage reads from there, so stages can be rerun independently.

```bash
V=data/raw/testclip.mp4

# 1. Video metadata -> metadata.json
uv run pbml metadata $V

# 2. Manual court calibration -> calibration.json + calibration_overlay.png
#    Opens a window: click each landmark in the order prompted
#    (s = skip hidden landmark, u = undo, enter = finish, esc = abort).
#    --background builds a median image over a time window, removing moving players.
uv run pbml calibrate $V --background 120 300
#    Or non-interactively from saved clicks:
uv run pbml calibrate $V --background 120 300 --points data/annotations/testclip/calibration_points.json

# 3. Person detection, court gating, ByteTrack over a time window (seconds)
#    -> detections_raw.parquet. Needs the calibration: detections whose feet land
#    off the court never reach the tracker. No need to cut the video: frame
#    numbers always refer to the source file.
uv run pbml track $V --start 120 --end 300

# 4. Resolve track fragments into four persistent players (P1-P2 near, P3-P4 far)
#    -> players_court.parquet. Takes seconds, so it can be re-tuned without re-tracking.
uv run pbml identify $V

# 5. Side-by-side debug video (frame + animated top-down court) -> topdown.mp4
#    Colors are player identities; "P2?" marks a low-confidence identity.
uv run pbml render $V

# 6. Identity accuracy against labeled person boxes
uv run pbml evaluate $V --labels data/annotations/testclip/identity_samples.json
```

Check `calibration_overlay.png` before running later stages: the red projected lines should sit on the painted court lines. Landmark definitions and the court coordinate system are in `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`.

## Initial Recording Constraints

MVP footage should be:

- doubles pickleball
- landscape video
- recorded from a fixed smartphone on a tripod or mount
- main (1x) lens; ultra-wide (0.5x) distortion breaks court calibration
- preferably behind a baseline, elevated if possible
- full court visible, including both near baseline corners
- camera stationary for the entire match

Recommended settings: 1080p at 60 fps (30 fps is acceptable), HDR video off, no Action or Cinematic mode.

These constraints make the ML problem dramatically more tractable.

## Test Footage

Put source videos in `data/raw/`, for example `data/raw/test_match_01.mov`. Videos, `data/raw/`, and `data/processed/` are gitignored and must never be committed.

For the Phase 0 prototype, a trimmed 1-3 minute clip containing several full rallies is ideal. Pipeline outputs will be written to `data/processed/<video_name>/`.

Small hand-authored annotations are tracked in `data/annotations/<video_name>/` as JSON only (anything else there is ignored):

- `calibration_points.json`: clicked court landmarks for `pbml calibrate --points`
- `identity_samples.json`: labeled player boxes for `pbml evaluate`

The annotations for `testclip` only make sense together with that source video, which is not in the repository.

## Planned Stack

Frontend:
- Next.js
- React
- TypeScript

Backend:
- Python 3.13 (uv)
- FastAPI
- PostgreSQL

ML / CV:
- PyTorch
- OpenCV
- YOLO
- ByteTrack or BoT-SORT
- TrackNet-style ball tracking

Infrastructure:
- Docker
- Redis + background job worker
- S3-compatible object storage

## MVP

The first usable version should:

1. Upload a match.
2. Store and queue it for processing.
3. Calibrate the court.
4. Detect and track all four players.
5. Transform player coordinates to a top-down court.
6. Track the ball well enough to identify active rallies.
7. Display an interactive rally timeline.
8. Produce basic movement/position analytics.
9. Allow users to correct predictions.

## Why Human Correction Matters

Sports CV will make mistakes. Instead of pretending otherwise, this project treats correction as a feature.

Corrections improve:

- trust in statistics
- usability of early models
- future training datasets
- model evaluation

The system should preserve both model predictions and user corrections.
