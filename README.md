# Pickleball Match Intelligence

A full-stack computer-vision and machine-learning project for turning ordinary smartphone pickleball footage into structured match data, interactive analytics, and tactical insights.

## Vision

The application should eventually let a player upload a match and receive:

- automated rally segmentation
- player and ball tracking
- court-position heatmaps
- movement and kitchen-transition statistics
- shot placement and shot-selection analytics
- recurring strategic-pattern detection
- evidence-backed coaching insights linked to specific rallies

The project intentionally separates perception from reasoning:

```text
Video
  -> Court calibration
  -> Player tracking
  -> Ball tracking
  -> Rally / hit / shot events
  -> Structured match representation
  -> Analytics
  -> Coaching explanation
```

## Initial Recording Constraints

MVP footage should be:

- doubles pickleball
- landscape video
- recorded from a fixed smartphone
- preferably behind a baseline
- full court visible
- camera stationary for the entire match

These constraints make the ML problem dramatically more tractable.

## Planned Stack

Frontend:
- Next.js
- React
- TypeScript

Backend:
- FastAPI
- PostgreSQL

ML / CV:
- PyTorch
- OpenCV
- YOLO
- ByteTrack or BoT-SORT
- TrackNet-style ball tracking

Infrastructure:
- Docker
- Redis + background job worker
- S3-compatible object storage

## MVP

The first usable version should:

1. Upload a match.
2. Store and queue it for processing.
3. Calibrate the court.
4. Detect and track all four players.
5. Transform player coordinates to a top-down court.
6. Track the ball well enough to identify active rallies.
7. Display an interactive rally timeline.
8. Produce basic movement/position analytics.
9. Allow users to correct predictions.

## Why Human Correction Matters

Sports CV will make mistakes. Instead of pretending otherwise, this project treats correction as a feature.

Corrections improve:

- trust in statistics
- usability of early models
- future training datasets
- model evaluation

The system should preserve both model predictions and user corrections.
